# About Me

## Hello There !

I am Anirudh Ramesh. If you are here to see my professional achievements, that's the CV page, I'm afraid.
This page is about everything else. 

## I am a...

### Computer Enthusiast:
I am passionate about everything computers, especially coding. I like to explore domains, and I have built video-games, machine-learning predictors, and even a Hot-Crazy Scale simulator webpage (HIMYM fans assemble). Check out my GitHub for a select few of them. Python is my language of preference, though I have spent my fair share of time with C, C++, C# (the Unity-related coding) and Java. Also, check out my Python book and Python blog when you get the chance.

### Cricket Enthusiast:
When I say enthusiast, I mean watch every game, read Twitter/X analyses, watch every highlight reel, and play when I can. Team I support is India, CSK, RCB-W, Sydney Sixers, and generally, the underdogs. Start a conversation about cricket, and I am always ready for a chat. 
Favourite Shot: Nothing like a classical cover drive
Favourite Players: Virat Kohli and Ellyse Perry

### LEGOs Guy:
Give me a box of LEGOs and you won't find me for hours. I am always looking to increase my minifigure collection, currently strong at almost 80. The UCS Millennium Falcon is the ultimate dream. 

### Movies and TV Shows Man:
I am a big fan of sitcoms, but my loyalty always lies with F.R.I.E.N.D.S. However, I am also a big fan of The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, Brooklyn 99, and How I Met Your Mother. I don't mind an occasional drama show as well, and I have had my stints with Suits, Sherlock, The Queen's Gambit and so on.
I have always been a big fan of movies. Hollywood movies are my preference, and I really like Action and Romcoms, but if you are watching a horror or a thriller movie, count me out.

### Geek:
Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Transformers, Ben 10, and a load of other things occupy a significant chunk of my brain-space. There may be plans to one day built an Iron Man suit of armor but we can keep that to ourselves now. 

Favorite Marvel hero: A lot of choices here
Favourite DC hero: Batman holds a significant lead here.
Favourite Star Wars character: Darth Vader
Favourite Ben 10 alien: Diamondhead, the nostalgia does play a significant role here.

That's about me.
